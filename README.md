# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals 

# Data types, operators and functions

## Introduction

Welcome everyone to Week 1 of your course!

The following instructions are provided to help you get to grips with some initial programming fundamentals.

Although we focus on the Javascript language, the structures and approaches you learn over the next exercises are applicable to all programming languages. The main thing that changes between languages is the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax).

For example if your 1st language is English and you visit Greece - when you visit a restaurant you may speak in Greek to place your food order. The structure of the sentence is very different to English. It is **syntactically** different. However the outcome and target of what you want to achieve, order an amazing meal, is the same whether you order in English or Greek.

In the coding exercises we just _choose_ to teach Javascript in the same way that you might have just _chose_ to speak in Greek.

## Technology

We'll be making use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest]( https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.
